"""
Given an array of strings words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each line has exactly 
maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. 
Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. 
If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, 
the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.
"""


"""
Example 1:

Input: words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."], maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
   "This    is    an",
   "example  of text",
   "justification.  "
]

Example 2:

Input: words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"], maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
  "What   must   be",
  "acknowledgment  ",
  "shall be        "
]
Explanation: Note that the last line is "shall be    " instead of "shall     be", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.

Example 3:

Input: words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain","to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"], maxWidth = 20
Output:
[
  "Science  is  what we",
  "understand      well",
  "enough to explain to",
  "a  computer.  Art is",
  "everything  else  we",
  "do                  "
]

 

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 300
1 <= words[i].length <= 20
words[i] consists of only English letters and symbols.
1 <= maxWidth <= 100
words[i].length <= maxWidth

"""

approach -- 

pack word greedily 

fit on the line with keeping the space even 

just divide the space even

for the last line make the left justification put spaces on the right side or give one space 

we have to do two parts 

1 get the number of lines 
2 put the words and the last line 

the first part 

max word 

go over the word and add the length with one space in between greedily apprioch 

if over than maxwidth 

we rmove the last word and increase the space and count the maxwidth 

space will be number of words - 1 , 3 words , space will be 2 

len(words) + num_space * num(words) - 1  == maxwidth

the we make a line
